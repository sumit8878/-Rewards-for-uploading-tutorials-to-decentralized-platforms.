# Rewards for Uploading Tutorials to Decentralized Platforms

## Project Description
This project incentivizes users to upload educational tutorials to decentralized platforms by providing monetary rewards. By leveraging blockchain technology, it ensures transparent, immutable tracking of uploads and reward distributions.

## Contract Address
0xd8b934580fcE35a11B58C6D73aDeE468a2833fa8

## Project Vision
To create a decentralized ecosystem where educators are rewarded for sharing knowledge, fostering a community-driven approach to learning, and encouraging the proliferation of educational content on decentralized platforms.

## Key Features
- **Tutorial Uploading:** Users can upload tutorials by providing an IPFS hash, ensuring that content is stored in a decentralized manner.
- **Monetary Rewards:** Users receive predefined rewards in ETH for every valid tutorial upload.
- **Decentralized Verification:** Immutable tracking of uploaded tutorials and claimed rewards.
- **Owner Management:** Only the owner can manage platform parameters like reward amounts and fund deposits.
- **Transparent Reward System:** All reward transactions are recorded on-chain.

## How It Works
1. Users upload their tutorial by submitting its IPFS hash.
2. The contract verifies that the tutorial hasnâ€™t been previously uploaded.
3. Upon successful upload, the user can claim their reward.
4. The owner can deposit funds to ensure the sustainability of the reward mechanism.

## Future Enhancements

- Support for additional content types.
- Integration with decentralized identity solutions for enhanced uploader verification.
- Community voting on the quality and relevance of uploaded tutorials.
